# Roadmap

This roadmap is a personal wishlist of features that I would like to eventually
incorporate into salesforcedx.nvim when I have time. Pull requests are always
welcome!

## High Priority

- [x] Run apex class/method test
- [x] Deploy local changes to org
- [x] Status line function for scratch org user
- [ ] Create internal logs
- [ ] Create apex class/apex trigger/apex unit test class/lwc
- [ ] Display default org details
- [ ] Open default org
- [ ] Set default org
- [ ] Validate sf/sfdx is installed
- [ ] Validate it is apex file
- [ ] Add documentation and types

## Low Priority

- [ ] Run apex test suite
- [ ] Retrieve remote changes from org
